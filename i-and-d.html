                    <p>Here at Reynholm Industries, above all else we value money. Our profit margin is our highest priorety,
                        second only to our shareholders. Our third biggest priorety, is that every person on our payrole
                        feels safe. That's why we've laid out a clear and concise set of policies that hold you, the employee,
                        responsible for any ill-feelings which may occur within during office ours, of within our building.</p>
