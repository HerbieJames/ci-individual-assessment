                    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                    <p>When we’re making decisions, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents">Equality Act 2010</a> gives us a duty to take into account the need to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>eliminate discrimination, harassment and victimisation</li>
                        <li>advance equality of opportunity</li>
                        <li>foster good relations between different parts of the community</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Equality Act protects people against discrimination on the grounds of protected characteristics, of which there are 9:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>age</li>
                        <li>disability</li>
                        <li>gender reassignment</li>

                    <p>We are required to consider all individuals in their day to day work, in shaping policy and in providing services. This is in line with the Public Sector Equality Duty (PSED) introduced by the Equality Act 2010.</p>

                    <p>This strategy ensures that, as a department, we continue to champion equality and diversity in all that we do, whether it concerns our staff or the wider public.</p>
                    <p>A refreshed diversity and inclusion strategy will be published in 2021.</p>

                    <p>Participating in external benchmarks helps us to understand and assess our performance against our aims, and to establish how we could use the experience of others to increase the diversity of our workforce and the inclusion in our workplaces and the services we provide.</p>
                    <p>We have previously been awarded a place in the Stonewall Top 100 Employer’s Index (2020) and in 2021 we were recognised as a Disability Confident Leader, a prestigious accreditation which will last for 3 years.</p>

                    <p>While external benchmarks are important opportunities to evaluate our progress towards our aspirations of being a model employer, we also recognise the immense value that staff support networks can add to our workplace and our public policy. These networks provide direct support to their members through ongoing engagement, they provide insight on the lived experience of our people and run events to keep staff and line management aware of how to respond to differing needs.</p>
                    <p>As an internal resource our networks have been instrumental in understanding how we can better engage with our stakeholders and the communities we serve.</p>
                    <p>Our internal networks take on a critical role, keeping us focused on creating an inclusive and engaged department. Some of our staff support networks are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The NETWORK – the Home Office race equality network</li>
                        <li>ABLE – the Home Office’s disability network</li>
                        <li>Spectrum – for lesbian, gay, bi and transgender staff</li>
                        <li>a:gender – the cross-government network for transgender, transsexual and intersex staff</li>
                        <li>GEN – Gender Equality Network (formerly Home Office Women)</li>
                        <li>Christian Network</li>
                        <li>Hindu Connection</li>
