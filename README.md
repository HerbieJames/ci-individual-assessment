## User Stories
- **Jen Barber, Relationship Management:**Â The user wants to gain a basic understanding of diversity and inclusion in the workplace or educational environment, so that they can apply those strategies to their team leadership. They seek straightforward information and tips presented in a clear, organised format.
> A landing page comprised of a concise and apparent navigation to the document on company policy creates an unintimidating path to the precise information sought after.

- **Denholm Reynholm, Policy Manager for Company:** The site's content is easy to update with new policy or alterations to previous policy as values and practices develop.
> Having a DOM where all policy is within one, sectioned HTML file makes it easy for the Policy Manager to, with the site owner's graces, edit this document, and replace it with ease. Effective use of comments throughout the i-and-d.html file also facilitate this nature of use.
